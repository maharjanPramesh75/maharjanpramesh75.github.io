            Khokana, a traditional and small Newari village 
             about 8 kilometers south of Kathmandu <br> (on the outskirts of Patan). Khokana is mainly known for the production of rich mustard oil since ancient time.
            <br> Khokana is a former Village Development Committee (VDC) which has been merged with the neighbouring VDC's of
             Bungamati, Chhampi, <br> Dukuchhap, Sainbu and other 38 VDC's to form the 
           Metropolitan City of Lalitpur in Lalitpur District in the Bagmati Zone of central Nepal.

                Khokana was also the first town in Nepal to be lit with electricity in 1911 AD during the reign of Rana Prime Minister Chandra Shamsher. Khokana has been nominated to be listed as a Unesco World Heritage, representing a vernacular village and its mustard-oil seed industrial heritage.
